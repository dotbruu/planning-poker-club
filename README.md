## Description üóí
Planning Poker Club is an open-source web application that allows for conducting Planning Poker sessions to estimate task effort in agile teams. The application uses TypeScript with Next.js on the frontend and NestJS on the backend, along with MongoDB as the database.

Planning Poker Club was created with the goal of facilitating planning and estimation in agile projects, providing a collaborative and intuitive experience for distributed or in-person teams. Through Planning Poker, teams can estimate the relative size of different tasks in a project using numbered cards and a consensus-based approach.

## Next Steps üìù
Here are some of the planned next steps for the development of Planning Poker Club:

- [] Include Time Counter: Add a time counter to control the discussion and estimation time for tasks during Planning Poker sessions.

- [] Remove User from Room Option: Allow the session facilitator to remove a user from the room if necessary.

- [] User Settings: Implement functionality that allows users to change their names and other personalized settings.

- [] Enhanced Emoji Selection with Listing: Improve the emoji selection in the user interface by providing a list of emojis to facilitate the choice during the estimation process.

- [] Unit and Integration Testing: Include unit and integration tests to ensure the quality and robustness of the code. This will help identify and address potential issues or regressions as new features are added.
